GEOG 328 Lab 2: Responsive Web Page Design

Project Overview

This repository contains the files for Rishi Biswas's GEOG 328 Lab 2 assignment.

The goal of this lab was to convert the content from the previous Lab 1 wiki page into a complete, responsive website using HTML5, CSS3, and JavaScript. The final site is hosted using GitHub Pages.

Features and Customizations

This website is fully responsive, meaning the layout and navigation bar adapt gracefully across mobile, tablet, and desktop screens.

The site also implements the following required custom styles: 
Feature              Location                                 
 Card Layout          index.html (About Me section)            
 Zebra Table          index.html (My Goals section) 
 Section Counter      section1.html and section2.html
 Navigation Bar       main.css 

Repository Structure

The project follows a well-organized file structure to separate content, styling, and scripts:

├── index.html
├── section1.html
├── section2.html
├── README.md        (This file)
